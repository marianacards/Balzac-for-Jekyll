 Kind of like negative space

It was the end of summer and school had just started. The art room was large. It had with more windows than wall space and art work scattered all over. Ms Blaine walked in ten minutes late, and asked us to sit around an empty table and draw a basquet of fruits that she placed at the center. "I don't want you to think about what is there... I wan't you to think about what is not", she said with a long, dramatic pause, "I am only interested in seeing how you think of negative space." She went on to threaten that anyone who drew the fruits themselves would not be admitted in the class. 

Over the next year, Ms Blaine would constantly remind us that in art we must understand what it is that we are displaying or projecting. The only way to do that, she would say, is to notice everything that you are not showing. 

Stephens-Davidowitz piece reminded me of that class. As he narrates through his discoveries of Google Search data, of all the secrets we think we only share with Google, I kept going back to the things we are not sharing. Stephens-Davidowitz references this idea:

"Google searches can be biased in favour of stuff people are uptight talking about"

Throughout the piece, I kept asking myself: 
What are the things that are so obvious, that no one needs to google them? 
What are the things that are so complicated and incomprehensible, that no one can google them due to a lack of ability to phrase?
What are the questions Google cannot answer? Do people know that Google will be incapable of answering them (and therefore don't even try)?
What are the things Google Search Data cannot tell us about humanity?

And perhaps a better question, what if Google decided to tell us all it knows? Not only the questions that are being asked but who is asking them. Would stop trusting the search engine and become embarrassed of our search? Would it lead us to the realization that we are all deeply flawed humans, who google embarrasing things? Would it lead to productive conversations in the relationaships where sex is not working and they seem unable to speak of it openly? Could it allow us to fight racism from a position of understanding those who believe they have the right to use the word "nigger"? 

Is Google the epitome of privacy, or is it the biggest murderer of privacy in history?
